<h2>Glue-ML definition language for Glue.AI</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
The "Glue-ML language" is a set of schemas for describing systems and connections.
<br/>
In particular it is used to describe:
<br/><br/>
I)   Assembly and configuration of data pipeline structures
<br/>
II)  Communicating state machines, with transition guards and transition actions
<br/>
</p>
<p>
As of 2016, the principal schemas of the Glue-ML language are defined 
using the following OWL (-Lite/RDFS) ontologies:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/stub22/glue-ai-v1_cogchar/blob/master/src_resources_core/org/cogchar/onto/MetaDir_owl2.n3">MetaDir</a> - Graph descriptions, collections and metadata</li>

	<li><a href="https://github.com/stub22/glue-ai-v1_cogchar/blob/master/src_resources_core/org/cogchar/onto/CircusRecipe_owl2.n3">CircusRecipe</a> - Pipelines of computation</li>
	
	<li><a href="https://github.com/stub22/glue-ai-v1_cogchar/blob/master/src_resources_core/org/cogchar/onto/AppProfile_owl2.n3">AppProfile</a> - Switchable, mergeable configuration and loading descriptions</li>
</ul>
<p>
These schemas are concerned primarily with category I features, i.e. defining pipelines.
Meanshile category II (state machine) structures are more purpose specific, and thus
are built as activity sites within such pipelines.
</p><p>	
Other ontologies are also used to specify schemas for UI features and particular
application scenarios, which is where explicit state machines come more into play.
</p><p>
We call Glue-ML a (pseudo-) "language" because it defines a programming model associated
to a vocabulary.  If Glue-ML were to be written out as "code", the syntax of Glue-ML would 
be any syntax compatible with RDF.   But more commonly, one works with a set of graphs 
(in files or databases) which together specify the required computation and application 
features for your application.  These graphs may be edited with a wide variety of tools.
